# üß† Cache Simulator Final Project

This project implements a **cache simulator** with support for both **basic indexing** and **advanced dynamic indexing** strategies, using the **1-bit Clock Replacement policy**.

---

## üìå Features

- Supports both **Basic** and **Advanced** index selection methods.
- Simulates memory access with **clock-based replacement policy**.
- Provides **hit/miss reporting** and **cache statistics output**.

---

## üîÅ Algorithm Overview

### Basic Mode:
- Uses consecutive bits (LSB) as index.
- Fixed mapping and simpler logic.
- Suitable for straightforward simulations.

### Advanced Mode:
- Dynamically selects index bits based on:
  - **Information Gain Ratio** (Q matrix)
  - **Bit Correlation Matrix** (C matrix)
- Adapts to memory access patterns for better cache performance.

---

## üóÇÔ∏è Input Files

- `cache_config.txt`: Contains cache parameters like `block_size`, `address_bits`, etc.
- `reference_list.txt`: Memory address access sequence.

---

## üì§ Output

- `result.txt`: Simulation results including:
  - Cache hit/miss results
  - Index bit choices
  - Overall statistics

---

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run

1. Implement all TODOs in the provided C++ template.
2. Compile using `g++` or other C++ compilers.
3. Run with:
   ```bash
   ./cache_simulator config.txt trace.txt output.txt
